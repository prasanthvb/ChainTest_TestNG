# ðŸš€ChainTest Reporting with TestNGðŸš€

This project implements **ChainTest Reporting** in TestNG, including a custom listener to capture screenshots of failed tests as Base64-encoded images. The reporting framework generates a detailed report after executing the tests.

## Features
- **Custom Listener**: Captures screenshots on test failure as Base64 images.
- **ChainTest Report**: Provides a detailed and interactive test report.
- **Easy Integration**: Run tests using `testng.xml`, and the reports will be automatically generated.

## Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or later.
- **Maven**: Ensure Maven is installed and configured.
- **TestNG**: Installed and configured as part of your Maven dependencies.
